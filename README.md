# kelo_todolist
A todolist web app built with django and has a login functionality. Users will only be allowed to perform the basic CRUD functions if logged in. Hope you enjoy!! The frontend Technologies was bootstrap and Jquery. On the other hand , the backend was built using Django, a python framework for web applications. On the next project I will integrate react native.
